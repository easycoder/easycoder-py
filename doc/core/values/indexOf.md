# indexOf

## Syntax:
`index of {variable}`

## Examples:
`print the index of Values`

## Description:
Returns the index currently set in the named variable. All variables are arrays, even when they only have a single element. The index is a pointer to which element should be accessed when using that variable. For a variable with only a single element this index is zero. See also `[set](../keywords/set.md) the elements of` and `[index](../keywords/index) {variable} to`.
